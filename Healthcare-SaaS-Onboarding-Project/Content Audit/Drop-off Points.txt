Step 1.4:Analyzed Drop-off Points 
Critical Drop-off Moments:
MedFlow Pro (Practice Management):
	Step 2-3 Transition (65% drop-off): Between email verification and first login 
	Reason: 6 competing action items in welcome email
	Setup Wizard Step 8 (45% drop-off): Revenue cycle management configuration 
	Reason: Complex billing terminology without explanation
	Tutorial Step 15 (60% drop-off): Multi-feature walkthrough fatigue 
	Reason: 23 steps covering too many topics simultaneously
HealthHub Connect (Patient Portal):
	Account Creation Step 4 (40% drop-off): Identity verification process 
	Reason: Unclear which personal information to use
	Dashboard Introduction (55% drop-off): Feature selection paralysis 
	Reason: 14 options with no priority guidance
	First Feature Use (50% drop-off): Medical terminology confusion 
	Reason: Terms like "EOB" and "care gaps" undefined
ClinicalOps Suite (EHR System):
	Between Implementation Call and Training (35% drop-off): Scheduling gap 
	Reason: Momentum lost between initial setup and training start
	Dashboard Configuration (70% drop-off): Widget overwhelm 
	Reason: 47 widgets enabled by default, no guidance on essentials
	Module Setup Phase (50% drop-off): Complex workflow decisions 
	Reason: 12 modules requiring technical decisions without context
Common Drop-off Patterns:
·	Information Overload Points: When 5+ options presented simultaneously
·	Technical Decision Moments: When users must choose without understanding implications
·	Progress Uncertainty: When users can't see how much more setup remains
·	Value Demonstration Gaps: When benefits aren't clear before effort required
·	Support Disconnects: When help isn't available at the moment of confusion
Estimated Impact:
·	Overall Onboarding Completion: 35-45% across platforms
·	Time to First Value: 2-4 hours average
·	Support Ticket Generation: 2.3 tickets per new user in first week
·	Feature Adoption: Only 20-30% of available features used after 30 days
