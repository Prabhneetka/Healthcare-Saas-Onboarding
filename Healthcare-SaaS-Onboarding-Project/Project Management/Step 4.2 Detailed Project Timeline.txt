Critical Dependencies & Risk Mitigation
Dependency 1: Legal/Compliance Review Timeline
	Risk: Healthcare regulations may require extended review periods
	Impact: Could delay launch by 1-2 weeks
	Mitigation:
	Submit content for compliance review by Day 10 (early submission)
	Prepare alternative content versions for common compliance issues
	Schedule weekly compliance check-ins starting Week 1
Dependency 2: Engineering Resource Availability
	Risk: Development team may have competing priorities
	Impact: Could delay implementation by 2-3 weeks
	Mitigation:
	Secure resource commitment in Week 1 stakeholder meetings
	Create detailed technical specifications to reduce development time
	Plan phased rollout to minimize development complexity
Dependency 3: User Testing Participant Recruitment
	Risk: Healthcare professionals have limited availability
	Impact: Could compromise testing quality or delay timeline
	Mitigation:
	Start recruitment in Week 1 (early start)
	Offer flexible testing options (remote, asynchronous)
	Partner with Customer Success team for participant identification
